    <h1>Grilled Chicken</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>While this is a pretty straightforward grilled chicken recipe, the vinaigrette at the end was a last minute touch that worked out nicely. I really like oil and vinegar-based sauces on grilled meats. They work beautifully with the smoky, caramelized exterior.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        
        <li>6 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ground paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 (5 pound ) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1/8 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to paste</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        
        <li>Whisk together yogurt, garlic, 3 tablespoons paprika, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon hot chile paste, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix in chicken pieces and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the bag and transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken pieces dry with more paper towels. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/4 cup olive oil, sherry vinegar, ketchup, 1/8 teaspoon hot chile paste, pinch paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 4 minutes with grill lid closed.</li>
        <li>Turn chicken and grill with lid closed until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spoon sherry vinegar mixture over cooked chicken and serve.</li>
    </ol>
